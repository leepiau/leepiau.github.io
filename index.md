### Projects

[Music & Mental Health](https://github.com/leepiau/mmh)\
\
This is a project where we take the results of a survey that asks respondents what, if any, genre of music they listened to,\
how frequently they listened to the genres, and whether it helped improve their (self-declared) mental health conditions.\
Based on this information, we recommend tracks to users suffering from the same mental health conditions.
